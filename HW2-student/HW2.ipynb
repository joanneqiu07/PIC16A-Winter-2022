    "Many of you may have encountered the output of machine learning models which, when \"seeded\" with a small amount of text, produce a larger corpus of text which is expected to be similar or relevant to the seed text. For example, there's been a lot of buzz about the new [GPT-3 model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3), related to its [carbon footprint](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robtoews/2020/06/17/deep-learnings-climate-change-problem/#2781c1b16b43), [bigoted tendencies](https://medium.com/fair-bytes/how-biased-is-gpt-3-5b2b91f1177), and, yes, impressive (and often [humorous](https://aiweirdness.com/)) [ability to replicate human-like text in response to prompts.](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/07/20/1005454/openai-machine-learning-language-generator-gpt-3-nlp/) \n",

    "We are not going to program a complicated deep learning model, but we will construct a much simpler language model that performs a similar task. Using tools like iteration and dictionaries, we will create a family of **Markov language models** for generating text. For the purposes of this assignment, an $n$-th order Markov model is a function that constructs a string of text one letter at a time, using only knowledge of the most recent $n$ letters. You can think of it as a writer with a \"memory\" of $n$ letters. \n"

    "### C. Generate Text\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we generate text one character at a time. To do so:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Look at the most recent `n` characters in our generated text. Say that `n = 3` and the 3 most recent character are `the`. \n",
